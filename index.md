### Progress of My Reasearch(我的科研進展)

##### Orthogonal Policy Gradient and Autonomous Driving Application
we present an approach called orthogonal policy gradient descent(OPGD) that can make agent learn the policy gradient based on the current state and the actions set, by which the agent can learn a policy network with generalization capability.

##### Visual Semantic Space
The information of images is disorganized and with noise, but language is high-level organized and abstract. In this research we try to find a share space between visual and semantic.

##### Reasoning Based on Visual Semantic
One less aspect of neural representation learning is short of logic-reasoning ability, in this research we map the embedding space with visual and semantic information to a logic graph space for reasoning tasks.
